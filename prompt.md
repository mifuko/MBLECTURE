> Process Log for Conceptual Model and Proof of Concept (PoC)
> Author: shiro kuanin  
> Context: This document records the reasoning, iteration, and design evolution during the development of a SysML v2 conceptual model and its proof-of-concept (PoC).  
> It reflects both human decision-making and AI-assisted reasoning used to shape the final model.

---

## Phase 1 — Concept Ideation

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Help me define a SysML v2 conceptual model for a Chrome extension that supports Japanese Kanji learning.”

**Intent**  
To establish the foundation of the conceptual model by identifying the purpose, boundaries, and potential stakeholders.

**Outcome**  
- Clarified that the concept centers on a *browser-based learning assistant* using lightweight interaction.  
- Identified key system elements: User, Browser Extension, Data API, and Storage Mechanism.  
- Defined an initial system boundary — focusing on client-side architecture with minimal backend dependency.

---

## Phase 2 — Expanding Conceptual Structure

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Extend the conceptual model to include service flow, user interaction, and data exchange patterns.”  

**Intent**  
To capture the *functional logic* behind the system rather than just structural components.  

**Outcome**  
- Added logical links among parts (User Interaction ↔ API ↔ Data Store).  
- Mapped user actions such as “fetch Kanji meaning,” “save to personal list,” and “review progress.”  
- Framed the model in a service-engineering perspective: value delivery through interactive feedback loops.

---

## Phase 3 — Structural Refinement and Abstraction

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Simplify the model while maintaining conceptual clarity. Focus on essential components and relationships.”  

**Intent**  
To ensure the SysML structure stays readable and aligned with conceptual goals rather than implementation details.  

**Outcome**  
- Consolidated components into four main blocks: *Frontend Extension, User Interaction Module, Kanji API, and Data Sync Layer.*  
- Removed redundant or overly technical parts (e.g., versioning or analytics sub-blocks).  
- Created one-sentence descriptions for each part, improving traceability for documentation.

---

## Phase 4 — From Concept to PoC Planning

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Add a PoC-level structure to show feasibility between the extension frontend and backend. Include minimal data flow and feedback loop.”  

**Intent**  
To transition from conceptual visualization to a small-scale proof of feasibility.  

**Outcome**  
- Added functional flow between Chrome Extension and external API.  
- Defined a lightweight local storage mechanism for offline mode.  
- Outlined error-handling and synchronization principles (e.g., request retries, data caching).  
- Clarified which conceptual components are implemented vs. theoretical.

---

## Phase 5 — Integration of System Thinking Elements

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Reflect the design decisions and rationale within the SysML parts. Link conceptual and structural viewpoints.”  

**Intent**  
To bring coherence between the conceptual model (why) and the system model (how).  

**Outcome**  
- Embedded rationale into part-level documentation.  
- Established traceability: each block has a clear function, responsibility, and value contribution.  
- Mapped design rationale: “user-centered interaction” → “simplified architecture” → “extensible API layer.”

---

## Phase 6 — Documentation Drafting

**Prompt (direct)**  
> “Create a `model.md` structure that explains the goal, approach, main components, and an implementation plan. Include a Markdown image tag for the system diagram.”  

**Intent**  
To produce a clear, standardized template for the model documentation.  

**Outcome**  
- Generated an outline for `model.md`:
  - **Goal of the Concept**  
  - **Approach to the Concept Creation**  
  - **List of the Main Components**  
  - **Draft Plan for Implementation**  
  - **Embedded System Diagram**
- Established documentation consistency and simplified future updates.

---

## Phase 7 — Iterative Revision and Validation

**Prompt (reconstructed)**  
> “Review the conceptual and PoC models. Ensure internal consistency and clarify the relationships among structural parts.”  

**Intent**  
To confirm that conceptual abstraction, implementation feasibility, and visual representation align with each other.  

**Outcome**  
- Validated logical coherence between conceptual model and PoC.  
- Revised component naming to follow consistent terminology.  
- Confirmed traceability from concept → structure → PoC → documentation.

---

## Phase 8 — Localization and Presentation Refinement

**Prompt (user input)**  
> “Add bilingual labels or explanations for Japanese/English presentation.”  

**Intent**  
To make the model and its documentation accessible for academic presentation in a bilingual environment.  

**Outcome**  
- Added Japanese text snippets for UI and explanation sections.  
- Ensured that terminology remained clear in both languages.

---

## Phase 9 — Final Consolidation

**Prompt (user input)**  
> “Help me compile everything into a final version I can submit.”  

**Intent**  
To unify all prior stages (concept design, PoC planning, and documentation) into a cohesive submission package.  

**Outcome**  
- Produced finalized versions of `model.md` and `prompt.md`.  
- Ensured that the modeling rationale and process trace are fully documented.  
- Prepared the model for academic review and reproducibility.

## Remarks on Provenance

Some prompts were written directly by the user; others were generated or refined through AI collaboration.  
When exact phrasing was unavailable, reconstructed prompts were used to maintain logical continuity.  
Each stage captures the **intent → reasoning → outcome** flow, demonstrating how design decisions evolved through iteration.

---

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Replace reconstructed prompts with original text if accessible.  
- Attach diagrams or versioned model snapshots for traceability.  
- Use this file as a companion record to `model.md` for system engineering documentation.
